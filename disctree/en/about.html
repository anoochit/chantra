<h2>OpenDisc</h2>

<br />

<p>Established in 2007, the OpenDisc project provides a collection of
high quality Open Source Software for Windows on a disc, and is updated at regular intervals throughout the year. There are
tens of thousands of OSS programs available for free download, making it
difficult to separate the quality and truly useful offerings from those
in need of further development. The landscape is made even more
complicated by the availability of a vast number of <em>Shareware</em>
and <em>Freeware</em> programs that you can also download freely from
the net. These, however are not <em>Open Source</em>, because the
author does not share the human readable source code for others to examine and build upon.</p>
<h2></h2>

<h2>Open Source Software</h2>

<br />

<p>Open Source Software (OSS) is provided with a license that gives the
end user the right to use it freely for private or commercial use. You
also have the right to inspect and even modify the underlying source
code. You can give away or sell the original version you received or
one with your modification, though you may be required to in turn pass
on the modified source code so that others can benefit from the changes
you have made. This last clause protects the developer's work from
unfair exploitation by others, while allowing the source code to be
released to the community. You are not required to pay royalties to
previous developers, but you are still permitted to charge money for
the sale of OSS.</p>
<p>This disc may have been given to you by a friend; or
sold to you for a small fee, and both are permitted. Keep in mind that
there are many different licenses, each of which has its own particular
set of conditions. If you plan to distribute or modify one of the
programs on this disc, please double check the license before you begin
so you'll be clear on both your rights and obligations.</p>

<p>If you have no interest in source code, you may ask why OSS even matters. One answer is that the release of source
allows external observers to inspect the internal functions of the
program, which means you can be confident that the program treats your
private data with respect.</p>
<p>One problem with proprietary software is
that it tends to use closed file formats to store your data. Once the
parent company stops supporting older versions of a proprietary
program, you may therefore have to upgrade to newer versions of that
program, at significant expense, in order to retain access to your
data. This does not happen with OSS, because when the source code for
opening and saving files is available, a third party can easily write
an import filter for the next generation of software, ensuring that
your data will always be available.</p>
<p>Finally, the release of source code
has in some cases spawned large communities of volunteer developers who
have in turn provided the world with highly useful, and entirely free
software such as Linux, OpenOffice.org, and Mozilla. These are then
available free of charge to schools or anyone else who may not have a
large budget available for software. So, you can see that the freedom
of software is important for everyone, not just software developers.</p>
