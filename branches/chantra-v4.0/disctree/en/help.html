<div class="jagged">OpenDisc is a volunteer project and we appreciate any
assistance you can offer. Currently we specifically need help with:<br />
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Translation</span> -&nbsp;Only
one in five people on Earth speak English, so naturally we're actively
seeking translators of <strong>any</strong> language (from our base,
English). What the job entails? Simply translating the front-end text
that the user sees - which are the menus, program selections and
miscellaneous pages on the disc. After the initial translation there'll
be little work to do in the exception of a new program or new text
somewhere on the disc, so you won't be burdened every time we release a
new version.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">At this stage we're
only after expressions of interest so we're after a show of hands of
anybody interested in helping with translation.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchasing</span> -&nbsp;At the
moment we have a score of sites selling the disc for people that
would rather purchase than download. Our list however pales in
comparison to the purchasing lists of the larger Linux distributions.
If you know of an online store that isn't already on our list, suggest
it!</li>
</ul>
Visit our website for more information, and if you&nbsp;can offer
anything
else not on the list, let us know.<br />
